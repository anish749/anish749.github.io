Hello, I am Anish.

I am a Software Development Engineer, and I love data, which gives me the nice hat of a Data Engineer.

My current area of expertise is Data Processing, Big Data, SQL and Functional Programming.

I started coding back in high school and have since maintained a deep interest in coding and now I engineer data products.

I am have previously worked as a Data & Backend Engineer at Spotify AB, and I'm currently based out of Stockholm, Sweden.

I also mentor others and provide help in solving problems in the world of Data.
For online sessions I work through [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/anishchakraborty/).
