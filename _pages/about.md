Hello, I am Anish.

I am currently consulting for Philips Innovation Services, India as a Data Engineer, while working at Fractal Analytics.
My current area of expertise is SQL and functional programming.

I started coding back in high school and have since maintained a deep interest in coding and now I engineer data products. 

Other than coding I also maintain a deep interest in films and photography as a hobby. Do have a look at my other blog at [Visual Krafts](https://visualkrafts.wordpress.com/)

For a detailed CV please have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishchakraborty) profile.
